## Overview
### Description
This app is designed to find events occuring around the user with data on location, amount of people, and date and time and add it to the users calendar.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Social/Productivity
- **Mobile:** This app allows users to have a map where events are happening, so they can see it on their phone. Itâ€™s more than a wbesite because it connects to your calendar, so you can see potential conflicts. It walso allows for you to see how many people will be there.
- **Story:** The app is meant for users to easily find things to do either around their home or in a new area, which is helpful in meeting new people. 
- **Market:** This app is meant for anyone who wants to go out and do soemthing in their area.
- **Habit:** Because people would be wanting to find things to do in their free time, this app would be used frequently as a way to find events. 
- **Scope:** This app would include getting data from maps and calendars in order to work properly. It would also include creating events and pushing that data to the database it came from.
